# 3D-LWJGL-Project

This project is for messing with LWJGL (LightWeight Java Game Library), which is a wrapper around OpenGL.
The project uses maven for building, LWJGL 3, and JOML (for matrix and vector math). Java 17 is required.

The project was born from me messing around with an entity component system and thinking it might alleviate some of the gripes I had with LWJGL.
It's very barebones and not very serious, but I'll be adding more to it as time goes on.
